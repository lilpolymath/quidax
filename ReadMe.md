### Quidax Front-end Skill Assessment

#### How to Run

- The entry point is `index.html` and the code can be run by opening that file on any web browser.

#### Assumptions

- Since the logo wasn't provided as a resource, I designed a custom one, using a book's svg icon.
- That the screens to implement are no more than what was provided.
- Other than the animations, transistions and functionalities demonstrated on the Figma Prototype, no other one was implemented like selecting another tab to navigate on the sidebar.

#### Requirements not covered

- The Search input display for mobile is not yet done.
- Featured books animation on mobile is not completed.

#### Issues faced

- Carousel animation on mobile was a bit diffcult to do. The buttons were not working as expected.

#### Feedback

Overall the whole test was good but it would be nice if the assets to be used are provided or we are told if we can improvised on our own.
